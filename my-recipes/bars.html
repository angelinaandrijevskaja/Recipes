        <h2 class="h2">Description</h2>
        <p>This is one of the best cookies of all time, although technically they're closer to a pie than a cookie. Nothing prepares you for that intense, awesome sweet-tart lemon flavor and custard, perfectly contrasted against that crisp, sweet buttery shortbread cookie. </p>
        <h2 class="h2">Ingridients:</h2>
        <ul class="ingr">
            <li class="ingr">1 cup all-purpose flour </li>
            <li class="ingr">½ cup unsalted butter at room temperature </li>
            <li class="ingr">¼ cup confectioners' sugar </li>
            <li class="ingr">¼ teaspoon vanilla extract </li>
            <li class="ingr">¼ teaspoon salt </li>
            <li class="ingr">2 large eggs </li>
            <li class="ingr">1 large egg yolk </li>
            <li class="ingr">1 cup white sugar </li>
            <li class="ingr">2 tablespoons all-purpose flour </li>
            <li class="ingr">¼ cup freshly squeezed lemon juice </li>
            <li class="ingr">1 tablespoon freshly grated lemon zest </li>
            <li class="ingr">1 teaspoon confectioners' sugar, or to taste </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="h2">Preparation steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li class="steps">Place an oven rack into middle position in oven and preheat oven to <span class="temp">350 degrees F (175 degrees C)</span>. Lightly oil an 8x8-inch baking dish.</li>
            <li class="steps">Place 1 cup flour and butter in a mixing bowl and mash with the back of a spatula or wooden spoon until thoroughly combined. Mix in 1/4 cup confectioners' sugar, vanilla extract, and salt; mash mixture together until mixture looks like a slightly crumbly cookie dough.</li>
            <li class="steps">Moisten your fingers with a little water and press dough into bottom of prepared baking dish. Use a fork to prick holes all over the crust.</li>
            <li class="steps">Bake crust on center rack in the preheated oven until crust edges are barely golden brown, <span class="time">22 minutes</span>.</li>
            <li class="steps">Beat eggs and egg yolks together in a bowl; whisk in white sugar and 2 tablespoons flour until smooth. Add lemon juice and lemon zest; whisk for <span class="time">2 minutes</span>. Pour lemon custard over crust.</li>
            <li class="steps">Bake on center rack until custard is set and top has a thin white sugary crust, <span class="time">25 minutes</span>. Let cool completely before cutting into bars. Dip knife into very hot water, run around the edge, and cut into 16 squares. Dust cookies with 1 teaspoon confectioners' sugar.</li>
        </ol>
